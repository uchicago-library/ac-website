#+Title: Attachment Converter

*** an open-source tool for batch-converting email attachments to preservation formats

* Install

** WSL Debian

#+begin_example
  $ sudo apt install attc
#+end_example

** MacOS

#+begin_example
  $ brew install attc
#+end_example

** Arch Linux

#+begin_example
  $ sudo pacman -S attc
#+end_example

* Quick Start Commands

Get started running Attachment Converter using these commands:

#+begin_example bash
  # To convert attachments of a single email
  $ attc --single-email < example-email.eml > example-email-converted.eml

  # To run a report of a mailbox
  $ attc --report < example.mbox

  # To convert attachments of a mailbox
  $ attc < example.mbox > example-converted.mbox
#+end_example

Note that the input mailbox must be in MBOX format.  If you have an
Outlook =.pst= file and want to convert it to =.mbox= in order to be
able to run Attachment Converter on it, we have found [[https://www.flawlessrhetoric.com/Using-libpst-to-convert-PST-to-MBOX,-and-understanding-Thunderbird's-folder-structure][Libpst]] to be a
useful utility for doing that conversion.
